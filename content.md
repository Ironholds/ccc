This application provides a pseudorandom generate of knit/purl sequences to amuse people who like playing with yarn. Or to put it another way, it's for a club of chaos crochetters. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/Ironholds/ccc).

(Yes, I know crochetting doesn't use knit/purl, but the joke doesn't work if we consider such little things as accuracy)
