## Chaos Crochetting Club

This was a project for a friend of mine to set up software that would generate pseudorandom knit/purl patterns,
given a specified number of rows and stitches, that would be web-accessible and available to download. The
live app can be accessed [here](https://ironholds.shinyapps.io/crochettingclub).
